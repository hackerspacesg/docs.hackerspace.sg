## Sports

### Running track

Just south of the space there is an awesome walkway to the Marina Bay Sands Helix bridge. Approximately 7km there and back!

### Swimming

[Jalan Besar Swimming Complex](https://www.myactivesg.com/facilities/jalan-besar-swimming-complex) is next to the North Entrance of the Jalan Besar Stadium, less than five minutes' walk away. Admission for adults is SGD 1.00 on weekdays and SGD 1.30 on weekends.

The swimming complex is closed when it rains. Call <a href="tel:+6562939058">62939058</a> in advance to ask if they are open. This saves you 10 minutes in case it is closed as a precaution for lightning strikes.

### Fitness Corner

For those who wants to use static stations at a fitness corner for exercises like pull-ups, a fitness corner can be found at the third level open spaces between [blocks 807 and 806](https://goo.gl/maps/sXvFZ) across the Jalan Besar Stadium.
