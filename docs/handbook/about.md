description: An introduction to HackerspaceSG, a community centre for Singapore's tech and maker scenes.

HackerspaceSG is Singapore's very own Hackerspace. 

There are hundreds of such [hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org) around the world, where people with common interests in computers, technology, science, digital and electronic art, come together to meet, socialise and collaborate.

Built by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, HackerspaceSG is the Singapore hacker community's home, living room and laboratory.  Come hang out with the community in the evenings.  Co-work with us during the day.  We also host regular events, meetups, presentations, workshops, and movie nights for the local community.

HSG is also Singapore's first co-working space.
