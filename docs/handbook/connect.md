## Chat

### Telegram

* Our [**Telegram group**](https://t.me/HackerspaceSG) is the (new-ish[^1]) main method for members of the public to get in touch with the HackerspaceSG community.

### <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>

* Some of us are still on IRC at [**#hackerspacesg** on Libera.Chat](irc://irc.libera.chat/hackerspacesg). Try one of these clients:
  * [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#hackerspacesg-irc:matrix.org)
  * [Libera.Chat web client](https://web.libera.chat/#hackerspacesg)

## Social media {#social}

### Twitter

* [@hackerspacesg](https://twitter.com/hackerspacesg)

### Facebook
* [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hackerspacesg), mostly for announcements.
* [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackerspacesg/), where you can post discussions and questions about anything that might be of interest to hackers.

## Email

* [**Mailing list**](https://groups.google.com/g/hackerspacesg) on Google Groups.

## (Not so social) media {#media}

### Photos

* [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=hackerspacesg%20OR%20hackersapce.sg&sort=date-posted-desc)
  * If you are a news organisation, you may use all pictures of the space on Flickr as long as you follow the licence as indicated on the respective photo's page.

### Videos

* [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/hackerspacesg) (mostly deprecated)

## Code

* Most of our active software projects can be found on our [**main GitHub organisation**](https://github.com/hackerspacesg).
* We also have an [archive organisation](https://github.com/hsgarchive/), because some of us are datahoarders.

[^1]: We really only started publicising it in August 2021.
