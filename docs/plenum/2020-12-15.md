## Ongoing business

### Change of directorship (was organisational shutdown)
- (Bob, Robert, Dyana) Call for directors has been issued via mailing list and Facebook page (not group)
 - Valentine and Jen are likely; they are considering registration as a social enterprise or similar.
 - Potential volunteers to assist on moving/removing/renovating have been identified.
 - Chucking out much of the crap and rearranging the tables so that more space is available for use.
 - Ideas include day passes for students (vs. say Starbucks), with a view to reaching break-even on that basis.
 - Dyana points out that, although we know the sequence for bank account handover, 6 weeks' of calendar is recommend to deal with SC paperwork.
 - Jen will do finance-related things with Dyana watching in January (rather than the reverse).
 - Valentine flagged an issue with an individual, Jen offered to intervence.
 - Once resolved, Valentine is willing to step as a director in January with Jen as treasurer.

### Broken and Orphaned Items
- (Valentine) Updates if any.
 - The not-turned-on-in-8-years TV
- Seeking consensus to [Old Hardware Pattern](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Old_Hardware_Pattern) the following:
  - Sofa under the projector
  - Large waterspot-marked table top opposite the shelves
  - Worn out office chairs
  - White stool (i.e. retain red stool)
  - Beanbags
  - 4 VGA monitors previously donated by Roland: free to good home
  - Likewise switches
  - Stuffed toys in claw machine
 - (Valentine) Post OHP call to mailing list and Facebook page+group and then release/dispose. Repeat as he has inclination.
- If/when we get garbage removed, the broken fridge and claw machine should go at the same time.

### Membership Survey
- (Valentine) Updates if any.
- Terminate item.

### Membership Marketing and Website Revamp
- (Robert) Update on revamp.
- (Valentine) Propose to remove this since the agenda item has been stagnant for [2.5 years](https://hackerspace.sg/plenum/2018-05-17/).
- (Valentine) Add PayNow QR to membership page for donations. Will completing adding today (Dec 15).
- Robert will off work Xmas/CNY period and plans to work on website then.

### Upcoming events that HackerspaceSG might be interested in
- FOSSASIA in March (largely online)
- No information about Maker Faire at present.

## New business

### Rewording of Membership Tiers
- (Valentine) Idea is that we should not be seen as _just_ a cheap co-working space.
- We have 12 desks in the main area, and 5 desks in the front area (caa 2020-10-30).
- 17 x $256 is $4,352 (still not enough to cover running the space).
- Propose to [anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)) $256/month as the standard membership tier.
- Propose to reword the $512 tier to Dedicated tier, $256 tier to Co-working tier, and $128 tier to Community tier.
- Pull request: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/hackerspace.sg/pull/171
- Proposed additional language: Community Tier members are welcome to visit the space any time, however regular use exceeding one day per week is not anticipated.

## Any Other Business

- "Someone" to post a sign reminding people not to overload the space's eletrical circuit with the shower heater on it.
- Valentine to firm up date for next plenum

## Next Meeting
- 2021-01-19 20:00 tentative (tentatively scheduled for 3rd Tuesday of every month, but subject to change depending on the schedule of key people)

### 21:12 Close
