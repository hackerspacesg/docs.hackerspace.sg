### Finance (Jen)

#### Cash

- **$??.?K** in the StanChart+PayPal as of 1 September 2021
  - Unable to report this month as bank credentials have stopped working.
- (Valentine, Jen) Submitted new internet banking form, awaiting access credentials and tokens.
- **0.66914519** in BTC

#### Accrual (up/down $?/month)

- The bank credential problem means that reporting this month is not possible. There do not appear to have been significant changes to income or expenses, so last month's figure is likely to be close:
> - Including predicted upcoming costs amortised monthly, we are **_down_ $1.44K** a month.
