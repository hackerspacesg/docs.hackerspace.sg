## Ongoing business

### Broken and orphaned items

- (Valentine, Andrei, Roland) Updates; review if Old Hardware Pattern works.
- Relevant Google Groups posts: https://groups.google.com/g/hackerspacesg/c/21ARBGrLhPo/m/tfFP6Wi4BgAJ

### Storage boxes

- (Valentine) Updates.
- As proposed, $64 tier gets 22L worth of storage, with every additional $64 contributed getting an additional 22L.
- We should start charging for additional boxes starting in September.

### Back room water issue / Shifting of Hardware Room

- GitHub issue: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/KGB/issues/7
- (Valentine) Updates, if any.

### KGB premises lease renewal / [Potential reboot](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Hackerspace_Design_Patterns_2.0#Hackerspace_Design_Patterns)

- (Valentine) Should we ask to renew for 2+2 years?

### Governance reboot

- (Jen, Martin) Updates, if any.

### Website revamp

- (Valentine) Updates, if any.

### House rules

- (Valentine) Discussion, if time permits.

### Recruiting additional members/sponsors

- (Roland) Discussion, if time permits.

### Large group gatherings in a COVID-endemic Singapore

- (Valentine) Discussion, if time permits.

### Upcoming events that HackerspaceSG might be interested in

- (All) Updates, if any.

## New business

### Admin help wanted

- (Valentine) We are actively looking for volunteers to reply to Facebook page messages asking to visit the space, among other things.

### Further adjustment of membership tiers

- (Valentine) Instead of the current 9 hour soft cap, should we move to business/non-business hours differentiation?
- Proposal: $64/$128 tiers can use the space after 6pm daily and on weekends, with 1 day a week allowance for weekday 9am–6pm OR 12mn–9am use.
- Pros: Easier to explain; might be more attractive to potential members looking to use the space _after_ work. Easier to set a norm that 9am–6pm on weekdays is quiet time, and all other times are not.
- Cons: One less carrot stick to offer members to help with tasks.

### Change of accounting firm

- (Joyce) Propose we cut costs by using a new accounting firm.

## Any Other Business (AOB)


## Next meeting

- 2021-09-21 20:00 tentative (tentatively scheduled for 3rd Tuesday of every month, but subject to change depending on the schedule of key people)
