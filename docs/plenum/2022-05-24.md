### Memberships/Contributions (Valentine)

#### Update on new members and contributions

- No changes to the following:
  - New members
  - Downgrades
  - Upgrades

#### Current membership/contribution breakdown by tiers

| Tier | Count |
| ---- | ----- |
| 16   | 8     |
| 32   | 0     |
| 64   | 14    |
| 128  | 13    |
| 256  | 0     |
| 512  | 1     |

- Val, Jen: Vouching for new membership may not be as reliable as before, given the addition of Switch and COVID attendances
- Val: "Do not sue us" (sic) policy is unfair to enforce only on members and not visitors of the space
- Val: We should buy a public liability insurance policy (somewhere around $200 a year)
  - Previously, onus was on visitors to have personal accident policy, but as we don't require or check for it, the liability insurance may make sense
