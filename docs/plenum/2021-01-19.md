## Ongoing business

### Change of directorship and bank signatories
- (Bob, Robert, Dyana, Jen, Valentine) Jen/Valentine have submitted forms to SCB for change of signatories; pending SCB response.

### Broken and Orphaned Items
- (Valentine) Updates if any.

### Rewording of Membership Tiers
- Pull request: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/hackerspace.sg/pull/171

### Membership Marketing and Website Revamp

## New business

### Storage Boxes
- (Valentine, Roland) Propose to implement a policy of keeping _all_ personal items and projects in stackable [22L/45L IKEA SAMLA boxes](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/samla-box-transparent-90180940/).
- V has hypotheses that members prefer to keep their stuff around their preferred desks, that some people might not like taking out individual items from their lockers, and that it's easier to keep everything into a nearby box at the end of their day.
- Spare boxes can be used to enforce [Flat Surface Pattern](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Flat_Surface_Pattern).
- All members get 1x 22L box with their membership. All boxes are to be clearly labelled. 4x6" label printer coming soon.
- Members (in some tiers?) can subscribe to additional boxes, like for lockers.
- Multiple stacking areas around the space. Shelves might be bought and installed.
- Dyana notes that any stack of < 2 Samlas is annoying to retrieve items from, based on very annoying personal experience; shelves are probably a good idea.

### Shifting of Hardware Room
- (Valentine) Received some feedback from visitors over the past few months that we should put more focus on the hardware area.
- Propose to move the hardware section to the front room.
- Window to the front room should be used as a gallery to display projects we've done (maybe 3D prints?).

### Large groups during Phase 3
- (Valentine) Seeking clarification on our policy for hosting large (>8 people) groups during Phase 3.
- What should members do if someone goes against the policy?

## Any Other Business

## Next Meeting
- Chinese New Year day 1 is 2021-02-12.
- 2021-02-16 20:00 tentative (tentatively scheduled for 3rd Tuesday of every month, but subject to change depending on the schedule of key people)
