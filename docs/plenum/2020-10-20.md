## Agenda:

### Organisation Shutdown
- (Bob, Robert, Dyana) discussion and proposed timeline
 - Robert and Bob wish to step down as directors on/before 30 April 2021 (filing date), and Dyana as treasurer at the same time.
 - No volunteers stepped forward to take on either role.
 - Decision not to undertake detailed shutdown discussion sequence as the 6-7 months from May-Nov is plenty.
 - Should new director(s) and treasurer step foward, a handover period of ~1 month is anticipated.
 - Valentine has expressed interest, subject to a solution being found on additional revenue sufficient for ~2 years operation.
 
### Broken and Orphaned Items
- (Valentine) volunteers to enforce Old Hardware Pattern on all unusable items because nobody's going to repair them here, and to identify (with help) orphaned items in the space for decluttering.
- Requesting for volunteers for Identification of Owners task.
 - General sense of the meeting was that it was OK for Valentina and/or Caj to step up and resume the pattern, with thought given to communication channels (e.g. mailing list, Facebook Group/Page)
 
### Membership Survey
- (Valentine) send members a short email asking:
    1. what their personal vision for a hackerspace is;
    2. what they hope to get out of such a place;
     - Space for a workshop not at home.
