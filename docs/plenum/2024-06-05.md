## New business

### 336D lease and future plans

- Renew another two years at potentially higher price?
  - Likely not
- Go somewhere else
  - Benji: somewhere smaller/more accessible
  - Robert: what is the targeted rental
    - Val: can try to get GopherCon sponsor another $1k/month
    - Maybe can use current membership + 1k as budget
  - icedwater: where are our options
    - Val: HDB has strict usage policy which may not align with our activities, e.g. office work only
    - Also, hardware room may not be possible to ventilate properly
    - Will mainly have to look at commercial spaces
    - Robert: just saw 475sqft option [Kelantan Lane](https://www.commercialguru.com.sg/listing/for-rent-kelatan-lane-25193877)
    - Another option [Upper Boon Keng Road](https://www.commercialguru.com.sg/listing/for-rent-upper-boon-keng-road-24803729)
  - Val: 4 people filled up the Hackerspace 365 form to commit to a $32 membership for one year

- iced: schedule in-person meetup around end of June for subsequent detailed discussion
  - iced: ideas for space v4, potential locations
  - Jen: get enough for the deposit + cost of moving

## Any Other Business (AOB)
